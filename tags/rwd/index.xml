      <description>General Guidelines for Choosing RWD: Purpose: Define the research question and the outcomes of interest. Choose a data source that aligns with the research purpose and objectives.
Data quality: Assess the quality, completeness, and accuracy of the data. Evaluate the data source based on the completeness of patient information, the length of follow-up, and the consistency of the data.
Sample size: Ensure the data source is of sufficient size to provide adequate statistical power to answer the research question.</description>

      <title>RWD Statistical Methods</title>

      <description>Common Statistical Methods in RWD Analysis Regression methods may not be possible Lack of Covariate Information: Regression methods rely on the availability of relevant covariate information to adjust for confounding variables. If important covariates are missing or poorly measured in the observational data, regression methods may not be able to adequately control for confounding.
Nonlinearity or Complex Relationships: Regression models assume linear relationships between the independent variables and the outcome. In observational studies, the relationships between variables may be nonlinear or complex, making it difficult to capture these relationships accurately using regression models.</description>

      <description>RWE is assuming a growing significance in regulatory submissions and reimbursement negotiations, making the availability of fit-for-purpose RWD sources crucial for generating robust evidence to support product development, market access, and post-approval surveillance. As data technology continues to advance, the RWD market has witnessed an influx of new entities. I have compiled a summary of RWD providers that have come to my attention.
