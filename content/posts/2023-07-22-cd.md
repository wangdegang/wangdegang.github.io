## How to RWD support Clinical Development
RWD refers to data collected outside of conventional randomized controlled trials, usually from health records, insurance claims, disease registries and patient-reported outcomes. Here's how it can be used to support clinical development in the pharma industry:

1. **Preclinical Development**: RWD can help identify potential indications for new drugs based on real-world patient conditions and treatment outcomes.
2. **Clinical Trial Design**: RWD can inform patient selection criteria, identify feasible study endpoints, predict trial length and recruitment rates, and design more meaningful comparative effectiveness studies.
3. **Clinical Trial Recruitment**: RWD can help identify potential trial participants that match the specific demographic and health criteria, accelerating recruitment and reducing costs.
4. **Post-Market Surveillance**: RWD can be used to track safety and efficacy of drugs after they are launched on the market, gathering real-world evidence of effectiveness and side effects that may not have been detected in clinical trials.
5. **Health Economics & Outcomes Research**: RWD can support cost-effectiveness studies and other health economic research by providing large-scale, real-world evidence of drug effectiveness and patient outcomes.
6. **Regulatory Decision-making**: Increasingly, regulatory agencies like FDA are considering RWD to supplement clinical trial data in their decision-making processes.
Before using RWD, companies need to carefully consider the quality and relevance of the data, potential biases, and the methods and tools for data analysis. It is also important to comply with all relevant data privacy and protection regulations.
