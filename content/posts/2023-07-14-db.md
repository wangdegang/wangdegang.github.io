RWD usually rests in the data lake. There is a query engine which acts as computing factory to process the data in the data lake and return the results. Analytics tools, such as SAS, R, and Python, connect to the query engine through ODBC or JDBC so a user can query the data. Here are code templates in these analytics tools so a user can connect to the query engine, submit SQL code, and bring the results to work sessions in the tools.

## SAS
- Bring the query result to the SAS session
```sas
proc sql;
   connect to odbc as x (datasrc= 'rwd' );
   select * from connection to x (select * from schema.table limit 5);
quit;
```

- Submit SQL code to the query engine
```sas
proc sql;
  connect to odbc as x (datasrc= 'rwd' );
  execute(create table mytable as
          select * 
            from schema.table
           limit 5) by x ;
quit;
```

## R Markdown
- Bring the query result to the R session
```sql 
# include this in r markdown {sql connection = con, output.var = to_R}
select *
from schema.table
limit 5
```

- Submit SQL code to the query engine
```sql 
# include this in r markdown {sql connection = con}
create table mytable as 
  with d01 as (select distinct patid, bus
                 from s.t),
       d02 as (select distinct patid, bus
                 from s.t2)
                       
  select '2016' as year, bus, count(distinct patid) as patn from d01 group by bus
  union
  select '2017' as year, bus, count(distinct patid) as patn from d02 group by bus                       
```

## Python
```python
import sys
import time
import warnings
import pyodbc
import pandas as pd

# connection to Dremio
cnxn = pyodbc.connect(dsn='dremio', autocommit=True)
cursor = cnxn.cursor()

# data schemas
sch1 = '"Global Development"."GD OPS"."HEOR"."RWDnA"."PMTX"'   
sch2 = '"Global Development"."User Development Area"."Degang Wang"'   

# bring data to pandas
s = '''
    select *
    from {m2}.np_proc_all
    limit 10
    '''.format(m2=sch2)
data = sql(s)
data

# submit SQL to the query egine
q = '''
    create vds {m2}.np_proc_1st as
    select pat_id, min(np_date) as np_index
    from {m2}.np_proc_all
    group by pat_id
    '''.format(m2=sch2)
query(q)
```
