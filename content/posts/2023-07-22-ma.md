## What is Market Access
Market access in the pharma industry refers to the process and strategies used to ensure that a drug or medical device is readily available to patients, is properly priced and reimbursed by healthcare systems. This can involve negotiations with regulators, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and policymakers. The goal of market access is to ensure that all patients who need a drug are able to receive it, regardless of their ability to pay. This is often a challenging process due to the high cost of drug development and the need for pharmaceutical companies to recoup their investments.
