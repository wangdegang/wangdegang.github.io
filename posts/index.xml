      <description>RWD usually rests in the data lake. There is a query engine which acts as computing factory to process the data in the data lake and return the results. Analytics tools, such as SAS, R, and Python, connect to the query engine through ODBC or JDBC so a user can query the data. Here are code templates in these analytics tools so a user can connect to the query engine, submit SQL code, and bring the results to work sessions in the tools.</description>

      <title>RWD Statistical Methods</title>

      <description>Common Statistical Methods in RWD Analysis Regression methods may not be possible Lack of Covariate Information: Regression methods rely on the availability of relevant covariate information to adjust for confounding variables. If important covariates are missing or poorly measured in the observational data, regression methods may not be able to adequately control for confounding.
Nonlinearity or Complex Relationships: Regression models assume linear relationships between the independent variables and the outcome. In observational studies, the relationships between variables may be nonlinear or complex, making it difficult to capture these relationships accurately using regression models.</description>

      <description>RWE is assuming a growing significance in regulatory submissions and reimbursement negotiations, making the availability of fit-for-purpose RWD sources crucial for generating robust evidence to support product development, market access, and post-approval surveillance. As data technology continues to advance, the RWD market has witnessed an influx of new entities. I have compiled a summary of RWD providers that have come to my attention.
